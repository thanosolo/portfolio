## About

This project was made to demonstrate my current and future work. I'm not a fan of noisy designs so I opted out of bloating
it with noisy animations like keyboard strokes, carousels, and the like.

I used Next.js and Tailwind, mostly because I enjoy working with this stack. It's simple enough that I could've done it without Next.js.
