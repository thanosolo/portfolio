        <p>
          I decided to dedicate my life to the pursuit of excellence in the
          field of software development.
        </p>
        <p>
          I consider myself product-oriented because I want the software I work
          on to be useful, performant, and scalable.
        </p>
        <p>
          What I love in software development is the never-ending learning that
          inherently comes with the field, and the joy of creating something I
          couldn&apos;t build before.
        </p>
