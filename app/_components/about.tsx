        <p>
          As a software engineer I&apos;m dedicated to building clean and performant applications. I consider myself user-centric, 
          but I put extra emphasis to teamwork, knowledge sharing to encourage and assist my teammates.
        </p>
        <p>While I&apos;m inclined to frontend development using modern tools like React and Vue,
          I have the knowledge to develop backend services with Node.js, Django, and .NET Core.
